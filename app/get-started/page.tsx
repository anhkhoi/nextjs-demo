      <p>
        Add your company name, contact information, and other basic details
        about your business.
      </p>
      <br />
      <strong>Start Accepting Payments</strong>
      <p>
        Connect a payment gateway to start accepting payments from your
        customers. If you don’t have a payment gateway or are unsure what this
        means we’ll help you create an account with a payment gateway like
        Stripe.
      </p>
      <br />
      <strong>Create Your First Customer</strong>
      <p>
        Create or import your first customers. This step must be completed
        before you can create Quotes, Invoices, Subscription Plans, etc. If you
        want your customers to sign up for your service themselves you can use a
        Hosted Signup Page instead.
